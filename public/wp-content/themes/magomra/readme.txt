== Description ==
Magomra was designed to be light-weight but powerful, and highly extensible with a dedication to subtle design sophistication. It looks great with zero configuration, or you can make all kinds of tweaks with the very detailed and user friendly options page. 

Magomra allows you to make adjustments to your blog's layout and behavior at a very fine-grained level. Everything from the symbol that is used as a separator, to user messages, to sidebar placement, colors, link placement. If ANYTHING bothers you about this theme, there's almost certainly an option to change or remove it.

== Features ==
* 2 pure CSS top navigation menus (hanging over and under the bottom of the header area, left or right aligned, 10 and 2 levels deep, respectively).

* A user-friendly, fine-grained options page, including:
-title, link, and footer seperator characters
-show or hide author, published date/time, last updated date/time
-Control appearance of admin links like "Edit Post"

* Custom header and background support

* Featured image support

* Sticky posts

* Threaded comments

* Ability to seperate trackbacks and comments

* Header/footer insert for raw HTML/PHP/JS/CSS for coders

* Custom post formats / automatic syntax highlighting in 20+ programming langauges.
